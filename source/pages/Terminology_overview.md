### Terminology incorporated in the IG
Consumer RTPBC exchanges involve common medical terminology as well as code sets that are specific to pharmacy benefit processing. Most of these pharmacy benefit code sets are proprietary to the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP). This effort is working with NCPDP and the HL7 Pharmacy and Financial Management Workgroups to determine an appropriate way to reference these code sets.
