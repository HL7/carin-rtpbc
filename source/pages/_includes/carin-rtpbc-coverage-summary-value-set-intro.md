This value set contains a set of coverage outcomes that may apply to a prescription product and pharmacy combination evaluated in the Real-time Pharmacy Benefit Check (RTPBC) process. In order to be meaningful to patients, this value set summarizes the range of coverage levels and restrictions into a smaller, more readily understandable group of values.
<br>

Below is the mapping between this value set and the more specific NCPDP coverage and restriction concepts used in the provider system-focused RTPBC transaction. (See <a href="Consumer_vs_provider_RTPBC.html">Consumer vs provider RTPBC</a> for more information about the relationship between the consumer-focused and provider-focused RTPBC processes.)
