This NamingSystem resource represents the proprietary National Program for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) **Pharmacy Type (955-HR)** code set--enabling it to be referenced within this guide. 
<br> 
<h3>Concept examples</h3> 
The full, up-to-date content of the NCPDP Pharmacy Type (955-HR) code set is only available to NCPDP members.
 
However, a past version of the code set is publicly available in the AHRQ United States Health Information Knowledgebase (USHIK). Below is a subset of concepts from that public source, for illustration purposes.
