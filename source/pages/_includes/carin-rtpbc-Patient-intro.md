This profile constrains the Patient resource for carrying the limited patient information required in the consumer real-time pharmacy benefit check (RTPBC) process. In RTPBC, the sole purpose of patient information is to enable the responding payer/PBM to locate the patient's insurance information. From there, pricing and coverage information is determined based on the patient's member and coverage information maintained by the payer.
