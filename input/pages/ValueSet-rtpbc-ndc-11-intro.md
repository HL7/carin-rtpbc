The consumer Real-time Pharmacy Benefit Check (RTPBC) process enables medication products to be specified using normalized 11-digit NDC codes, which consist of:

- 5-digit labeler segment
- 4-digit product segment, and
- 2-digit package segment

... with no dashes. 

<br/>

Each segment is front-padded with a leading zero if the base NDC segment has fewer digits than required by the normalized version. 

*Example: *

- base NDC: 0777-3105-02
- equals normalized NDC-11: 00777310502
