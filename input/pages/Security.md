FHIR does not mandate a single technical approach to security and privacy; rather, the specification provides a set of building blocks that can be applied to create secure, private systems. 

Implementers are expected to follow core [FHIR security principles](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/security.html).

In addition, the [FHIR Security and Privacy Module](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/secpriv-module.html#6.0] [http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/secpriv-module.html) describes how to protect patient privacy.
