### Must Support elements in this profile 
**Client and Responding systems**<br>
All of the elements identified above are marked Must Support though not all will be required in a given implementation (the address composite itself and each element within have a minimum cardinality of 0, to support differing patient lookup approaches). The appropriate cardinality for address elements is to be determined by implementers.
